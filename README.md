# Need A Ride-Share?

## Summary

This Analysis was conducted to provide information analysis to the CEO of a hypothetical ride-sharing company, Pyber.
Total data for different levels of urban development was gathered, and their relative statistics were compared in order
to consider future development or feedback for Pyber.

## Analysis

### The Graph
![Graph](https://github.com/Jelsik/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)
As the graph shows, somewhat unsuprisingly, the Urban market is the largest for total profits in ride sharing. Not only is it the best by 
total numbers, the trend on it's fare amount over the given time period is generally stable too, save a few spikes during 
march.
	Monthly Rural fare remains low and slow consistently. This is to be expected. Because of the isolation of some rural areas, and the
dispersion of places to go, most individuals who choose to live in the countryside own their own vehicle, and as expected
Suburbia takes it's place in the center.

### Chart
![Chart](https://github.com/Jelsik/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/FinalSummaryDF.PNG)
The chart tells a general story of the profitiabilty of PyBer in different areas. However, when one looks into the specific
details, a more complex story develops. Though the total fare of suburban rides may be half the size of urban ones, the total
number of rides from suburban areas is less than half the number of rides in the urban areas. The average fare of a suburban
ride is six dollar shkgher than that of it's urban counterpart. Driver saturation is at play here. There are more than twenty
times the number of drivers in urban areas compared to rural ones, and the rural driver makes three times as much per fare
on average than their urban counterpart. There is only a ten dollar differnce in fare from highest average
to the urban's lowest of $24.53. This could be a simple case of supply/demand, or perhaps something deeper.

## Summary Recommendations

As a result of these findings, I would suggest these three routes of action to our CEO:
1: To test to see if higher rural fare costs are related to driver avaiability, I would reccomend
trying to build greater "driver infastructure," or advertising there. Once there are more rides on the road,
the supply/demand relationship can be tested. Perhaps that can bring the country up to speed.
2:The Suburbs are a market that has potential development. The positive ratio (when considered outside of total numbers)
Suburban returns have compared to Urban, presents another opportunity for expansion and further analysis. Perhaps the entire
year could be charted.
3:Urban centers ares most profitable, but you perhaps need to look into helping city drivers out with their
average fare collected. It is by far the lowest. The city is where most of the business is being done,
and it would be unfortunate to lose out of revenue with a decline in drivers.
